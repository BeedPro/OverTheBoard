OverTheBoard (OTB for short) is a free to play chess web application focused on realtime gameplay and tournament based matchmaking where players are paired up agaisnt eachother in round-robin format tournaments. Players are placed in leagues which reflect their skill in playing chess and can move up and down leagues if they are ranked first after a tournament or ranked last respectivily.

OTB is written C# and relies on the ASP.NET Core framework. The chess game itself uses a combination of [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js) and [chessboard.js](https://github.com/oakmac/chessboardjs) in order for the logic and rendering of the board, the chess timer has been implimented as a JQuery plugin. The web application uses [SignalR](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/signalr) in order to allow the players to see the board being updated in real time.

## OTB Information

Players are given an ELO rating of 1200 and are put into the `Unranked League`. Upon reaching a rating of 1500 or greater the player will then be placed into the `Ranked League` and will from then on not be allowed to become `Unranked`. Upon being `Ranked` the player will be placed into the global tournament queue of OTB and tournaments will be generated by divisions within the leagues. Players will not be told what division they are in and can only see other players of the same division after the tournament has been created and displayed in the users' brackets page.
